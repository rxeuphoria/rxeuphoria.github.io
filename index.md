# Benjamin C. Ackerman, PharmD. 
## Pharmacy Director turned Software Dev

Selecting a career without a crystal ball is difficult.  Who knew? 


### At my core? A desire to help people.

A brief timeline...

- 2010: Pre-health college path selected.
- 2013: Pharmacy school starts.
- 2017: Pharmacy school ends.  Pass licensure exams out of the gate and have a staff pharmacist job within 3 months.  
To my chagrin, being a pharmacist is not what I anticipated it being. 
- 2018: Promoted to Director of Pharmacy.  Life's good, but even 
- 2020: A year that requires some extra detail...

1. Early 2020: The business owner of where I worked sold the book of business to a regional competitor.  
Huge bummer, but my job was now redundant in the new structure and I assisted in negotiating my own layoff.  1/10 Do not recommend.  
2. April 2020: Started coding with the assistance of some friends.  
3. July 2020: Joined Grand Circus Java/Back-end bootcamp.  
4. September 2020: Graduated bootcamp.  Job hunt begins in earnest for an entry-level job in a new field.
5. December 2020: Still no dice on the job front, but slowly developing my network in tech.  
The days spent applying to jobs and being rejected suck, but the days spent coding are actually fun.
